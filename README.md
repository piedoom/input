input
=====
A simple CMS designed to let clients directly edit simplified databases, and developers to code in simple PHP.

**WARNING:**
Input is still in development.  DO NOT use this on a public server.  People will see it, and you will mess up your files!

**What you'll need:**
Input so far requires a few things.  You need:
- A MySQL database called "input"
- An auto-increment primary index column called "id"
